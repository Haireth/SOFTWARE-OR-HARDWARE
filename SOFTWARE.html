      <h1>What is a Software</h1>

      <p>
        A software is a collection of programs, data, and instructions that tell
        a computer how to perform specific tasks or operations. It encompasses
        all the non-physical components of a computer system that enable it to
        function and perform useful work. Software can be categorized into
        several types:

    <div class="item item-4">
      <h4>System Software</h4>
      <p>
        This includes the operating system (like Windows, macOS, Linux) and
        utilities that manage computer hardware and provide a platform for
        running other software. System software acts as an intermediary between
        the hardware and the user or application programs.

    </div>

    <div class="item item-4">
      <h4>Application Software</h4>
      <p>
        These are programs designed to help users perform specific tasks or
        functions. Examples include word processors (like Microsoft Word), web
        browsers (like Google Chrome), and graphic design tools (like Adobe
        Photoshop).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="item item-8">
      <h4>Middleware</h4>
      <p>
        This software connects different applications or services, enabling them
        to communicate and interact with each other. Middleware is often used in
        distributed systems or cloud computing environments.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="item item-10">
      <h4>Driver Software</h4>
      <p>
        These are specialized programs that allow the operating system to
        communicate with hardware devices like printers, graphics cards, or
        network adapters.
